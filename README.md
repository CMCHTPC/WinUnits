Windows Headers for Delphi and FPC

This headers are translated from the SDK 10.0.10075.0.
Since translation of the Windows headers is a lot of work ;) I only added the functions that are not available in the "out of date"
translations of Delphi and Lazarus but who I needed for my project or the examples of the other header translation (DirectX 12 and Media 
Foundation).

This translations will be updated from time to time, so at the end there should be an up to date translation of the whole
Windows API available.

Good luck and happy coding!
